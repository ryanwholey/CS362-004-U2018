# Testing

## Random Testing:
There are 3 random test suites currentl, randomtestcard1, randomtestcard2 & randomtestadventurer
To run each, just use their corresponding make command

- make randomtestcard1
- make randomtestcard2
- make randomtestadventurer
 You can take a look at their output and coverage by using less on their corresponding .out files

 less randomtestcard1.out
 less randomtestcard2.out
 less randomtestadventurer.out

 To see explicit error messages corresponding to random testing failures, change NOISY_TEST in each of the source files from 0 to 1 and rerun the make commands.
